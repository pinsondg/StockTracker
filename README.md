# StockTracker
A app to help track your stock/option positions. This app was made with .NetCore and Blazor.

## Tiingo API Key
For security reasons, I am keeping my Tiingo API key private. In order to get the live stock tracking features of this app, you must obtain your own API key.
This can be done at https://www.tiingo.com. Once your key is obtained, you will need to insert the key into an appsettings.json under the property `APIKeys.TiingoAPIKey`.

## TODO Items
* Add more tests
* Add front end tests
* Add graphs
* Re-organize position bricks into better layout
* Add better colors
* Add totals
* Dockerize and package together with local DB
